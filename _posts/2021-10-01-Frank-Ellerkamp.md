## Bio

Frank is a STEM teacher trainer from Switzerland with a background as an engineer in ICT security. Working as an educator for teachers as well as for students from kindergarten till college on the one hand and as the head of education of the leading Swiss LEGO Education Partner on the other hand, he found his dream combination of jobs. As such, Frank is able to provide feedback from the teachers directly to the vendors and vice-versa. Further, due to his insights, he develops optimized and customized curricula.

During his lessons, Frank uses his well-known simple models to give the participants more possibilities (and bricks) for creativity and solutions and to ensure that everyone is successful. 

One important objective in his STEM career is to attract the interests of girls in science in their early school years. As a Roberta Coach, he raises awareness among teachers in workshops and create gender-aware lesson plans.

Frank supports WRO, FLL and other science challenges as coach, mentor or ambassador.
