## Bio

Rogel enjoys designing his own moving Lego creations and keeping them aesthetically pleasing that people can enjoy watching and hopefully building them. He enjoys creating great ball contraptions, robots and alternative builds of existing Lego sets. This allows him to pursue and combine his passion for mechanics, programming, photography, video-taking and also serves as his artistic outlet. This is also a bonding activity for him with his family as his daughter and wife are both Lego enthusiasts as well.
