## Bio

"Christian started building his own LEGO MINDSTORMS robots in 2007 with the NXT. A few years later, he started to make video tutorials to help beginners to get into programming. Today, Christian enjoys teaching robotics in workshops in addition to the videos. They help him to understand the problems that beginners can have when they learn to program. Of course, he still builds in his spare time to relax. He loves to include shining or pulsing lights into his models.
A passion of him is to explore the limits of combining different systems like Power Functions and Robot Inventor."
