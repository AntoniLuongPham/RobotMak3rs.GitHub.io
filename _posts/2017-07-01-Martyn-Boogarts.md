## Bio

Martyn started to build LEGO robots in 1986, when he used the Education Dacta line. He started and lead an after school robotics club. In 1998 he got the first RCX MINDSTORMS set and became known as a robot builder. Together with friends, he builds many massive show models to promote LEGO robotics.

In 2000 he was one of the initial organizers of LEGOWORLD where he was responsible for the foreign guests and the computer LEGO. Since then, he has been involved in both LEGOWORLD NL as well LEGOWORLD CPH in the MINDSTORMS booth.

Upon the release of the NXT robot, he was asked by LEGO to be part of the MUP2, a secret group of 13 people, to betatest and explore the next generation of LEGO MINDSTORMS before it was even revealed to the general public in 2005.

In cooperation with many friends, he kept on creating mega- large show models. For example, in secret, the release of the NXT2 was prepared and, at the same time, a Large Highbay Warehouse was created by Martyn and his colleagues to promote the NXT2 at LEGOWORLD.

Several contributors on the website "theNXTstep" teamed up to write a bestselling MINDSTORMS idea book, and later a one kit wonders book.

With the upcoming release of the EV3, a big event in 2010 in both Atlanta (FIRST LEGO League Championships) and Utrecht (NL) was organized to share a sneak peek of a successor to the NXT. There, Martyn was asked to help and design one of the official bonus models, the Wack3m a game to show kids that you can build real strong models. In addition, he designed EV3MEG was created, a friendly small helper robot in a large factory. Later, the packing plant and the EV3MEG mini were created and showed during LEGOWORLD shows. A major highlight for Martyn was having officially made build instructions with his name as a designer (although it was a team effort).

Martyn works closely with LEGO Education and became an Certified LEGO Education Trainer. The recent years, he has created many unofficial Technic remix models, by combining a TECHNIC box with the MINDSTORMS box. He now displays all official Robot Remix models to emphasize that you you too can create cool models with just 2 boxes.
