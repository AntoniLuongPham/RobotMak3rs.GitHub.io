## Bio


Being a software engineer, I'm constantly building mobile apps or web applications at work. On my own time, I build with LEGO and the software code to remotely control or make my creations work.  I really like that, with LEGO Robotics, I can quickly design and build almost anything I can imagine and be able to share it widely so others can play with it and rebuild it themselves as well!
