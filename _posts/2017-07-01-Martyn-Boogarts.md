## Bio

Martyn started to build LEGO robots in 1986, where he used the Education Dacta line. He started and lead a Robotica after school club. In 1998 he got the first RCX mindstorms set and was already known as a robot builder. together with friends he build many massive show models to promote LEGO robotics. 
In 2000 he was one of the initial Organizers of LEGOWORLD where he was responsible for the foreign guests and the computer LEGO. since then he is always involved in both LEGOWORLD NL as well LEGOWORLD CPH for the MINDSTORMS stand. Upon the release of the NXT robot he was asked by LEGO to be part of the MUP2 a secret group of13 to pretest and explore the next generation of LEGO MINDSTORMS before it was even revealed to the general public (end 2005). In cooperation with many friends he kept on creating mega large show models. From the website "theNXTstep" several authors teamed up to write a bestselling MINDSTORMS idea book, and later a one kit wonders book.
Still in the secret groups the release of the NXT2 was prepared and a Large Highbay Warehouse was created to promote the NXT2 at LEGOWORLD.
with the upcoming release of the EV3, a big event in 2010 in both Atlanta (FLL) and Utrecht (NL) was organized to pre-show a successor of the NXT. there he was asked to help and design one of the official bonus models, the Wack3m a game to show kids that you can build real strong models. Also the EV3MEG was created, a friendly small helper robot in a large factory. later the packing plant and the EV3MEG mini were created and showed during LEGOWORLD shows. This for sure was highlight as the official made building instruction carried his name as the designer (although it was a team effort). Martyn worked close with education and became an Certified LEGO Education Trainer. The last years he created many unofficial Technic remix models, by combining a TECHNIC box with the MINDSTORMS box and now he shows all official Robot Remix models to emphasize that also you can create cool models and for that you don't need more then just 2 boxes.
