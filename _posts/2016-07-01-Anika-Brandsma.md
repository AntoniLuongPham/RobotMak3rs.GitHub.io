## Bio


During working hours I'm a mechanical engineer at a high-tech compan. In the evening I'm a ROBOTMAK3R. I prefer building robotic animals as well as bringing life to LEGO Friends and LEGO Elves sets with the incorporation of MINDSTORMS, BOOST or WeDo.  I share my creations all around the world including at World Robot Olympiad (WRO), FIRST LEGO League (FLL), and LEGOWORLD. My entire family enjoys building with LEGO. We all have a strong passion for nature & technology.
