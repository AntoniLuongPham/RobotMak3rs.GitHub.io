## Bio

The RCX 1.0 was the first item he has bought on the internet, back in 1999. From that moment on he used programable bricks to move his LEGO Creations. His starting point is creating things, that have not been created before and whatever you want to create with LEGO is possible. He is a specialist in building big structures and models that take a total different way of building. 
 
He has shown every year a new BIG creation on LEGO World in the Netherlands and Denmark for more than 10 years with his friend Maryn Boogaarts. 
They are member of their own LUG, MEGLug together with Gerrit Bronsveld. Where Meg stands for (M)artijn, (E)ric and (G)errit. and refers to MEGA (BiG).

In addition, he and Martijn have supported the FLL in the Netherlands for years as the Mindstorms doctor to help teams on competition days with problems and advice on their robots.

He himself thinks his LE-GO-Cart is the best MOC he has build.
